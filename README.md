# NetflixHomePageClone
I would like to introduce my Netflix Home Page Clone project, crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's an impressive recreation of Netflix's familiar interface, showcasing my web development skills. From the sleek design to the responsive layout, this project captures the essence of Netflix and serves as a testament to my frontend expertise.
